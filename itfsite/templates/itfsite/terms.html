Neither you nor we will be entitled to join or consolidate Claims by or against the other in any arbitration, or to include in any arbitration any Claim as a representative or member of a class, or to act in any arbitration in the interest of the general public or in a private attorney general capacity.</p>

<p>C. This section 10 is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code, as amended).  The party filing a Claim(s) in arbitration must file its Claim(s) before a single arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its then-current commercial disputes rules.  For any Claim of less than $10,000, we may elect non-appearance based arbitration through AAA or another mutually-approved arbitration provider, and in such event the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, video conference, and/or online, and/or be based solely on written submissions of the parties.

<p>F. You and we each shall take all steps and execute all documents necessary for the implementation of arbitration proceedings.  Neither the parties nor the arbitrator may disclose the content or results of any such arbitration, except as required by court order or applicable law, rule or regulation.  The parties shall share equally the costs assessed by the AAA or the arbitrator, and other joint costs of the arbitration, but each party shall bear its own attorneys’ and experts’ fees and other costs incurred that are solely attributable to that party’s decisions and actions.</p>
 
<p>G. Subject to the foregoing, you agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute, claim or controversy arising from this Agreement shall be in the federal and state courts located in the District of Columbia, U.S.A. </p>

<h2>11. General Terms</h2>

<p>The laws of the District of Columbia, U.S.A., excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern this Agreement and your use of the Services.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights hereunder, and any attempt to the contrary shall be void.   Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement benefits and binds the respective successors and assigns of the parties.
